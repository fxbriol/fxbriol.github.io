At UCL, I teach mostly at the 3rd year BSc or MSc level including:
* Module lead for STAT0043 *Inference at Scale* (Spring 2024, 2025 & 2026).
* Module lead for STAT0032 *Introduction to Statistical Data Science* (Autumn 2019, 2020, 2021 & 2022). 
* Classes for STAT0027 *Foundations Fortnight*, aimed at MSc students in the Statistical Science department (Autumn 2019, 2020, 2021 & 2022)
* Tutorials for STAT0005 *Probability & Inference* (Autumn 2019 & 2021).

I also regularly supervise BSc and MSc students for their dissertation at UCL, mainly through STAT0034/STAT0035/STAT0036. See the [Supervision](https://fxbriol.github.io/supervision/) page for more details.

Beyond this, I also regularly teach PhD-level research courses; e.g.:
* Masterclass on "Stein's method as a computational tool" [[*slides*](https://fxbriol.github.io/pdfs/fxbriol_Stein_slides.pdf)]. STOR-i centre for doctoral training at Lancaster University.
* Course on "Robust and scalable simulation-based inference" [[*slides*](https://fxbriol.github.io/pdfs/slides-SBI-course.pdf)]. Greek Stochastics 2025.
