At UCL, I teach mostly at the MSc level including:

* Module lead for STAT0032 *Introduction to Statistical Data Science* (Autumn 2019, 2020 & 2021). 
* Classes for STAT0027 *Foundations Fortnight*, aimed at MSc students in the Statistical Science department (Autumn 2019, 2020 & 2021)
* Tutorials for STAT0005 *Probability & Inference* (Autumn 2019 & 2021).

I also regularly supervise BSc and MSc students for their dissertation at UCL, mainly through STAT0034/STAT0035/STAT0036. See the [Supervision](https://fxbriol.github.io/supervision/) page for more details.
