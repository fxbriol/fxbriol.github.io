I enjoy supervising research projects and regularly take on MSc and PhD students. I am particularly interested in hearing from potential PhD students with a strong mathematical background and/or strong programming abilities. If you are interested in my research area, feel free to contact me by email to discuss opportunities at UCL or The Alan Turing Institute. 

## PhD Students

**Before Applying:** Please contact me via email before submitting a formal application. When getting in touch, make sure to highlight your research interests and how these align with my own. To do this, you might find it helpful to check out my [publications](https://fxbriol.github.io/publications/) page, which contains a list of my papers as well as a list of project pages describing some of my current research interests.

***Openings for September 2022 (and onwards)*** I will be looking for a PhD student interested in joining from September 2022 onwards. Although I am open to applications for projects related to any of my areas of interest, I would be particularly keen to find a student interested in *generalised Bayesian inference* which will be co-supervised with [Jeremias Knoblauch](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=4TPsxlsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (who will soon be joining UCL on a permanent basis). See the following papers to get a broad idea of this research area. [(Paper 1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07359) [(Paper 2)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02063).

**Application Process:** I can supervise PhD students at UCL through a number of routes. One important point is that applications for PhD positions at UCL are separate from applications for scholarships so you will usually have to submit two types of applications. Here are a few routes possible:

* The [*UCL Statistical Science*](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/prospective-postgraduates/phd) department PhD programme. This is a standard PhD programme, and is most appropriate if you are interested in a PhD on statistical or machine learning theory or methodology. To obtain funding as an international student, the main option is the [Graduate Research Scholarships](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/graduate-research-scholarships) and [Overseas Research Scholarship](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/overseas-research-scholarships). It is common to apply for both of these simultaneously, and the deadline is usually in mid-January. For UK nationals, you can apply for the department scholarships, which are usually advertised in February/March.
* The [centre for doctoral training (CDT) in *Foundations of AI*](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/study/research-degree-foundational-artificial-intelligence). This is most appropriate if your research interests are at the intersection of statistical and machine learning theory or methodology. Unlike the Statistical Science department, this is a programme with a cohort of students all doing AI-related research, and includes a number of cohort events throughout the year. Again, the standard route for international students are the [Graduate Research Scholarships](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/graduate-research-scholarships) and [Overseas Research Scholarship](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/overseas-research-scholarships). For UK nationals, the CDT has a number of scholarships and it is often possible to apply later (although early applicants are more likely to be allocated funding).
* The [London NERC doctoral training partnership (DTP)](https://london-nerc-dtp.org/). This PhD programme is a joint programme across a number of London institutions, and is appropriate if you are interested in a project at the intersection of statistics/machine learning and the environmental sciences. For this particular programme, you first need to be admitted to the NERC DTP (a process I am not involved with), and can contact me during your first year at the point where you are looking for a supervisor.

You can find more details on the application process for PhDs at UCL through [the UCL graduate study guide](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/applying-graduate-study/what-you-need-complete-application). You can also find tips on writing a convincing research statement on [this page](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/sites/prospective-students_graduate/files/potential-supervisor.pdf).

**Alternative Funding Routes:**  

There are a number of other possible funding routes. At UCL, this includes the [CDT in *Financial Computing and Data Science*](https://financialcomputing.org/), the [CDT in *Data Intensive Science*](https://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/cdt-dis/) and the [Health Data Research UK/Turing PhD programme](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/talent-training/hdr-uk-turing-phd-programme-funded-by-the-wellcome-trust/?_cldee=ci5jaGFuZGxlckB1Y2wuYWMudWs%3d&recipientid=contact-243cf3cbd2a9e711810970106faa95f1-cd798151ea1648d0a88aaf88b8173974&esid=83591eb5-de0a-ea11-a811-002248070f4c). Several schemes independent of UCL may also be of interest. A list of possible options is provided [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/funding-students-postgraduate-research-courses#charities), and the [following tool](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/scholarships-finder) may be of help when searching for a scholarship you are eligible for. Depending on your country of origion, you may also be eligible for a [fee partnership from UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/fee-partnerships). Finally, one other option is the commonwealth PhD scholarships for ["high-income countries"](http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/apply/phd-scholarships-high-income-countries/) or ["least developed countries and fragile states"](http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/apply/phd-scholarships-least-developed-countries-and-fragile-states/).

## Postdoctoral Researchers

I do not currently hold any funding for postdoctoral researchers, but would be happy to hear from anyone interested in joining my group and/or supporting strong candidates for external funding applications.

## MSc Students

At UCL, I supervise MSc students through the MSc Statistics, MSc Data Science and MSc Computational Statistics and Data Science programmes. If you are currently enrolled in one of these programmes, feel free to contact me about research projects which align with my research. Unfortunately I am not able to supervise any other MSc projects at this time (whether at UCL or not).
