I enjoy supervising research projects and regularly take on MSc and PhD students. I am particularly interested in hearing from potential PhD students with a strong mathematical background and/or strong programming abilities. If you are interested in my research area, feel free to contact me by email to discuss opportunities at UCL or The Alan Turing Institute. 

## PhD Students

**Before Applying:** Please contact me via email before submitting a formal application. When getting in touch, make sure to highlight your research interests and how these align with my own. To do this, you might find it helpful to check out my [publications](https://fxbriol.github.io/publications/) page, which contains a list of my papers as well as a list of project pages describing some of my current research interests.

***Openings for September 2022 (and onwards)*** I will be looking for a PhD student interested in joining from September 2022 onwards. Although I am open to applications for projects related to any of my areas of interest, I would be particularly keen to find a student interested in *generalised Bayesian inference* which will be co-supervised with [Jeremias Knoblauch](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=4TPsxlsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (who will soon be joining UCL on a permanent basis). See the following papers to get a broad idea of this research area. [(Paper 1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07359) [(Paper 2)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02063).

**Application Process:** I can supervise PhD students at UCL through a number of routes. One important point is that applications for PhD positions at UCL are separate from applications for scholarships so you will usually have to submit two types of applications. Here are a few of the main [funding](https://fxbriol.github.io/supervision/funding/) routes.

## Postdoctoral Researchers

I do not currently hold any funding for postdoctoral researchers, but would be happy to hear from anyone interested in joining my group and/or supporting strong candidates for external funding applications.

## MSc Students

At UCL, I supervise MSc students through the MSc Statistics and MSc Data Science programmes. If you are currently enrolled in one of these programmes, feel free to contact me about research projects which align with my research. Unfortunately I am not able to supervise any other MSc projects at this time (whether at UCL or not).
