The favourite part of my job is to supervise research projects and I supervise on BSc, MSc and PhD students. Before contacting me about opportunities, please read the page below carefully.

## PhD Students

I am looking to recruit one PhD student starting in Autumn 2024. 

**What I am looking for:** 
I am particularly interested in hearing from potential PhD students with a strong mathematical background and/or strong programming abilities. Beyond this, what I value most is students who are driven and passionate about their work.

**What you can expect from me as supervisor:** I am really passionate about supervision and heavily invested in helping my PhD students succeed. I usually meet 1-1 with my students about once a week to discuss progress in research, give advice, and more (although this can be slightly more or less depending on the stage of the PhD). I also organise meetings every three to six months to check on the progress my students are making towards their career goals, and how I can support them in doing so going forward. Finally, I know many find research to be a lonely activity, but I don't believe that has to be the case. My research group has weekly group meetings and regular social events. We also have a culture where everyone is encouraged to help each other and/or work as a team, rather than in competition with one another. 

**Before applying:** Please *contact me* via email before submitting a formal application. When getting in touch, make sure to highlight your research interests and how these align with my own. To do this, you might find it helpful to check out my [publications](https://fxbriol.github.io/publications/) page, which contains a list of my papers as well as a list of project pages describing some of my current research interests.

**Application process:** I can supervise PhD students at UCL through a number of routes. One important point is that applications for PhD positions are often separate from applications for scholarships. In those cases, you will usually have to submit two types of applications, one for admission to UCL and the other for funding. Here are a few of the main [funding routes](https://fxbriol.github.io/supervision/funding/) to consider. If you get in touch with me about an application, I am happy to help you navigate this.

## Postdoctoral Researchers

I do not currently hold any funding for postdoctoral researchers, but would be happy to hear from anyone interested in joining my group and/or supporting strong candidates for external funding applications.

## MSc Students

I supervise MSc students through the MSc Statistics and MSc Data Science programmes at UCL. If you are currently enrolled in one of these programmes, feel free to contact me about research projects which align with my research. Unfortunately I am not able to supervise any other MSc projects at this time (whether at UCL or not).
