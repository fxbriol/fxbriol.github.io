I enjoy supervising research projects and regularly take on MSc and PhD students. Before contacting me about opportunities, please read the page below carefully.

## PhD Students

I am particularly interested in hearing from potential PhD students with a strong mathematical background and/or strong programming abilities. 

**Before Applying:** Please contact me via email before submitting a formal application. When getting in touch, make sure to highlight your research interests and how these align with my own. To do this, you might find it helpful to check out my [publications](https://fxbriol.github.io/publications/) page, which contains a list of my papers as well as a list of project pages describing some of my current research interests.

**Application Process:** I can supervise PhD students at UCL through a number of routes. One important point is that applications for PhD positions are sometimes separate from applications for scholarships. In those cases, you will usually have to submit two types of applications, one for admission to UCL and the other for funding. Here are a few of the main [funding routes](https://fxbriol.github.io/supervision/funding/) to consider. 

[***Update: I am not able to support any more PhD applications with start date in Autumn 2022 or Autumn 2023. If you are keen to work with me and would like to start in Autumn 2024, please get back in touch with me from October 2023 onwards.***] 


## Postdoctoral Researchers

I do not currently hold any funding for postdoctoral researchers, but would be happy to hear from anyone interested in joining my group and/or supporting strong candidates for external funding applications.

## MSc Students

I supervise MSc students through the MSc Statistics and MSc Data Science programmes at UCL. If you are currently enrolled in one of these programmes, feel free to contact me about research projects which align with my research. Unfortunately I am not able to supervise any other MSc projects at this time (whether at UCL or not).
