## About

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Statistical Science at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/). I am also a Group Leader at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), the UK's national institute for Data Science and AI, where I am affiliated to the [Data-Centric Engineering programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering#introduction). There, I lead research on the [Fundamentals of Statistical Machine Learning](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/fundamentals-statistical-machine-learning).

My research focuses on building statistical and machine learning methods which enable the use of large-scale models in the physical, environmental and engineering sciences. I focus on both foundational and computational problems. On the foundational side, I develop methods to merge large-scale models with data, focusing on robustness to model misspecification. On the computational side, I focus on algorithms which can make use of the structure of these complex models to vastly reduce the associated computational challenges. My work has been recognised through a Best Paper award at AISTATS, a Discussion Paper in the journal Statistical Science, an Amazon Research Award, and an honorary mention for the Savage Award amongst others.

Prior to joining UCL, I did my undergraduate degree (MMORSE, 2010-2014) at the University of Warwick, then did a PhD (2014-2019) as part of the joint centre for doctoral training between the departments of Statistics at Warwick and Oxford. I then spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher, first in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London, then in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge.

For more details on my work, see my [Publications](https://fxbriol.github.io/publications/) page or my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=yLBYtAwAAAAJ&hl=en) profile. Alternatively, you can catch me at one of my [Presentations](https://fxbriol.github.io/presentations/).

## News

* I am looking to recruit a PhD student for the academic year 2024-25. Please have a look at [this page](https://fxbriol.github.io/supervision/) for further details, then feel free to get in touch directly via email.

* I recently appeared in the ["Machine and Molecules"](https://youtu.be/fv4JvSo44QA?feature=shared) podcast where I discuss my broad interest in robustness to model misspecification, how I got started with research, and the ongoing work of my research group at UCL.

* I received an EPSRC small grant in the mathematical sciences for research on ["Robust Foundations for Bayesian Inference"](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/Y011805/1) (EP/Y011805/1).
