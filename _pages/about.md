## About

I am Professor of Statistics and Machine Learning (effective Oct 2025) at [UCL Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/), where I co-lead the [Fundamentals of Statistical Machine Learning](https://fsml-ucl.github.io) research group. 

My research focuses on developing statistical and machine learning methods, and I am also interested in applications in the sciences and engineering. I enjoy designing methods to merge large-scale scientific models with data, which requires the development of novel computational methods, inference methods that remain robust to model misspecification, and tools for uncertainty quantification. I have worked on a broad range of topics including Bayesian robustness, Monte Carlo methods, probabilistic machine learning, Stein's methods, kernel methods and simulation-based inference.

At UCL, I am co-director (and scholar) of the [UCL ELLIS unit](https://ellis.eu/units/london-ucl), theme lead for [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/computational-statistics-and-machine-learning) (CSML) within UCL Statistical Science, and co-director of research of the [UCL CDT in Data-Intensive Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-intensive-science-industry). Beyond UCL, I am also an elected board member for the CSML section of the [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/statistical-computing/), an Associate Editor for the [SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty Quantification](https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/siam-asa-journal-on-uncertainty-quantification-juq) and [Bayesian Analysis](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis), and an Area Chair for [AISTATS](http://aistats.org/aistats2024/index.html).

Prior to my current position, I did my bachelors and masters (MMORSE) at the University of Warwick, then a PhD through a joint CDT in statistics and machine learning at Warwick and Oxford. I then spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher, first in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London, then in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge. I then joined UCL, where I was a lecturer (2019-2023) and then associate professor (2023-2025). From 2020-2023, I was also a Group Leader in Data-Centric Engineering at The Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national institute for Data Science and AI.

For more details on my work, see my [Publications](https://fxbriol.github.io/publications/) page or my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=yLBYtAwAAAAJ&hl=en) profile. Alternatively, you can catch me at one of my [Presentations](https://fxbriol.github.io/presentations/).

## News

* I have been promoted to *Professor of Statistics and Machine Learning* at UCL, effective 1st October 2025.

* I will be giving a short-course on "Robust and scalable simulation-based inference" at [Greek Stochastics 2025](https://www.stochastics.gr/meetings/omicron/index.html).

* I will be visiting the Isaac Newton Institute's programme on ['representing, calibrating & leveraging prediction uncertainty from statistics to machine learning'](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/rcl/) for part of July.

* I have three papers accepted at ICML 2025 on topics from the [computation of nested expectations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18284), to [kernel embeddings](https://mashanaslidnyk.github.io/assets/pdf/kqe.pdf) and [robust Bayesian ML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02450). In addition, I am contributing to the organisation of a ['pre-ICML meeting'](https://sites.google.com/view/pre-icml-london-2025) at UCL on the 3rd of July.
