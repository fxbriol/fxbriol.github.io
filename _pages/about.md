## About

I am Professor of Statistics and Machine Learning at [UCL Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/), where I co-lead the [Fundamentals of Statistical Machine Learning](https://fsml-ucl.github.io) research group. 

My research focuses on statistical and machine learning methodology, though I am also interested in applications in the sciences and engineering. My primary focus it the design of methods to merge large-scale scientific models with data, which requires the development of novel computational methods, inference methods that remain robust to model misspecification, and tools for uncertainty quantification. 

At UCL, I am co-director (and scholar) of the [UCL ELLIS unit](https://ellis.eu/units/london-ucl), theme lead for [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/computational-statistics-and-machine-learning) (CSML) within the department of Statistical Science, and co-director of research of the [CDT in Data-Intensive Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-intensive-science-industry). Beyond UCL, I am also an elected board member for the CSML section of the [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/statistical-computing/), an associate editor for the [SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty Quantification](https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/siam-asa-journal-on-uncertainty-quantification-juq) and [Bayesian Analysis](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis), and an area chair for [AISTATS](http://aistats.org/aistats2024/index.html).

Prior to my current position, I did my bachelors and masters (MMORSE) at the University of Warwick, then a PhD through a joint CDT in statistics and machine learning at Warwick and Oxford. I then spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher, first in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London, then in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge. I then joined UCL Statistical Science, where I was a lecturer (2019-2023) and then associate professor (2023-2025). From 2020-2023, I was also a Group Leader in Data-Centric Engineering at The Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national institute for Data Science and AI.
