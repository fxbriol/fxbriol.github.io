## About

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Statistical Science at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/), where I co-lead the [Fundamentals of Statistical Machine Learning](https://fsml-ucl.github.io) research group. My research focuses on developing statistical and machine learning methods for the sciences and engineering. I am interested in designing methods to merge large-scale scientific models with data, which requires the development of novel computational methods and of inference methods that remain robust to model misspecification.

My research in this area has been recognised through a Best Paper Award at AISTATS, a Blackwell-Rosenbluth Award, oral papers at ICML, AISTATS and UAI, a 'discussion paper' in the journal Statistical Science, and an honorary mention for the Savage Award. My students have also received a number of student paper awards from the American Statistical Association and the International Society for Bayesian Analysis. Finally, my work has been funded through several EPSRC grants and an Amazon Research Award.

I am co-director of the [UCL ELLIS unit](https://ellis.eu/units/london-ucl), theme lead for [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/computational-statistics-and-machine-learning) (CSML) within UCL Statistical Science, and co-director of research of the [UCL CDT in Data-Intensive Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-intensive-science-industry). I am also an elected board member for the CSML section of the [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/statistical-computing/), an Associate Editor for the [SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty Quantification](https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/siam-asa-journal-on-uncertainty-quantification-juq) and for the journal [Bayesian Analysis](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis), and an Area Chair for [AISTATS](http://aistats.org/aistats2024/index.html).

Prior to joining UCL, I did my bachelors and masters (MMORSE) at the University of Warwick, then did a PhD as part of the joint centre for doctoral training between the departments of Statistics at Warwick and Oxford. I then spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher, first in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London, then in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge. From 2020-2023, I was also a Group Leader in Data-Centric Engineering at The Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national institute for Data Science and AI.

For more details on my work, see my [Publications](https://fxbriol.github.io/publications/) page or my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=yLBYtAwAAAAJ&hl=en) profile. Alternatively, you can catch me at one of my [Presentations](https://fxbriol.github.io/presentations/).
