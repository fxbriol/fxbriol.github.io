There are a number of different routes you can take for applying to do a PhD with me at UCL. I have summarised the various routes on this page because the various routes can be a bit confusing, but feel free to contact me if you have any further questions. 

**Main Funding Routes:**  

The [*UCL Statistical Science*](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/prospective-postgraduates/phd) department PhD programme is a standard PhD programme most relevant if you are interested in doing a PhD on statistical or machine learning theory or methodology. The department has a list of scholarships available [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/prospective-postgraduates/studentships), but this does not always contain all the information until applications for a particular scholarship have opened. Here's a brief summary of what to expect:

* **Departmental Teaching Assistant Scholarships** This option is for either UK nationals or international students, and usually opens in February/March. The students get a full scholarship in exchange for a small amount of teaching throughout their PhD.
* **UCL Research Excellence Scholarships**: Another option for both UK nationals and international students is the [UCL Research Excellence Scholarship](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/research-excellence-scholarship). The deadline is usually in mid-January, and this caries no teaching load.
* **Martingale Foundation Scholarships**: For UK nationals, one option are the scholarships from the [Martigal Foundation](https://martingale.foundation). The deadline is usually in October, and again there is no teaching load associated.
* **CDT Scholarships**: This year is the renewal year for most center for doctoral training in the UK. This means we do not yet know whether UCL will be assigned any CDT (although I expect the answer will be yes!), and so a number of scholarships may become available later in the year.

You can find more details on the application process for PhDs at UCL through [the UCL graduate study guide](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/applying-graduate-study/what-you-need-complete-application). You can also find tips on writing a convincing research statement on [this page](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/sites/prospective-students_graduate/files/potential-supervisor.pdf).

**Alternative Funding Routes:**  

There are a number of other possible funding routes. At UCL, this includes the [CDT in *Financial Computing and Data Science*](https://financialcomputing.org/), the [CDT in *Data Intensive Science*](https://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/cdt-dis/) and the [Health Data Research UK/Turing PhD programme](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/talent-training/hdr-uk-turing-phd-programme-funded-by-the-wellcome-trust/?_cldee=ci5jaGFuZGxlckB1Y2wuYWMudWs%3d&recipientid=contact-243cf3cbd2a9e711810970106faa95f1-cd798151ea1648d0a88aaf88b8173974&esid=83591eb5-de0a-ea11-a811-002248070f4c). Several schemes independent of UCL may also be of interest. A list of possible options is provided [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/funding-students-postgraduate-research-courses#charities), and the [following tool](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/scholarships-finder) may be of help when searching for a scholarship you are eligible for. Depending on your country of origion, you may also be eligible for a [fee partnership from UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/fee-partnerships). Finally, one other option is the commonwealth PhD scholarships for ["high-income countries"](http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/apply/phd-scholarships-high-income-countries/) or ["least developed countries and fragile states"](http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/apply/phd-scholarships-least-developed-countries-and-fragile-states/).
