* The [*UCL Statistical Science*](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/prospective-postgraduates/phd) department PhD programme. This is a standard PhD programme, and is most appropriate if you are interested in a PhD on statistical or machine learning theory or methodology. To obtain funding as an international student, the main option is the [Graduate Research Scholarships](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/graduate-research-scholarships) and [Overseas Research Scholarship](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/overseas-research-scholarships). It is common to apply for both of these simultaneously, and the deadline is usually in mid-January. For UK nationals, you can apply for the department scholarships, which are usually advertised in February/March.
* The [centre for doctoral training (CDT) in *Foundations of AI*](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/study/research-degree-foundational-artificial-intelligence). This is most appropriate if your research interests are at the intersection of statistical and machine learning theory or methodology. Unlike the Statistical Science department, this is a programme with a cohort of students all doing AI-related research, and includes a number of cohort events throughout the year. Again, the standard route for international students are the [Graduate Research Scholarships](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/graduate-research-scholarships) and [Overseas Research Scholarship](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/overseas-research-scholarships). For UK nationals, the CDT has a number of scholarships and it is often possible to apply later (although early applicants are more likely to be allocated funding).
* The [London NERC doctoral training partnership (DTP)](https://london-nerc-dtp.org/). This PhD programme is a joint programme across a number of London institutions, and is appropriate if you are interested in a project at the intersection of statistics/machine learning and the environmental sciences. For this particular programme, you first need to be admitted to the NERC DTP (a process I am not involved with), and can contact me during your first year at the point where you are looking for a supervisor.

You can find more details on the application process for PhDs at UCL through [the UCL graduate study guide](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/applying-graduate-study/what-you-need-complete-application). You can also find tips on writing a convincing research statement on [this page](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/sites/prospective-students_graduate/files/potential-supervisor.pdf).

**Alternative Funding Routes:**  

There are a number of other possible funding routes. At UCL, this includes the [CDT in *Financial Computing and Data Science*](https://financialcomputing.org/), the [CDT in *Data Intensive Science*](https://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/cdt-dis/) and the [Health Data Research UK/Turing PhD programme](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/talent-training/hdr-uk-turing-phd-programme-funded-by-the-wellcome-trust/?_cldee=ci5jaGFuZGxlckB1Y2wuYWMudWs%3d&recipientid=contact-243cf3cbd2a9e711810970106faa95f1-cd798151ea1648d0a88aaf88b8173974&esid=83591eb5-de0a-ea11-a811-002248070f4c). Several schemes independent of UCL may also be of interest. A list of possible options is provided [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/funding-students-postgraduate-research-courses#charities), and the [following tool](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/scholarships-finder) may be of help when searching for a scholarship you are eligible for. Depending on your country of origion, you may also be eligible for a [fee partnership from UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/fee-partnerships). Finally, one other option is the commonwealth PhD scholarships for ["high-income countries"](http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/apply/phd-scholarships-high-income-countries/) or ["least developed countries and fragile states"](http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/apply/phd-scholarships-least-developed-countries-and-fragile-states/).
